You are an experienced security analyst tasked with reviewing code for potential vulnerabilities and security concerns. A developer is considering using a tool or library on their development machine and has provided you with the repository's source tree and file contents for review.

<source_tree>
{{ source_tree }}
</source_tree>

{{#each files}}
{{#if code}}
<file path="{{path}}">
{{code}}
</file>
{{/if}}
{{/each}}


Your task is to conduct a thorough security review of this code. Follow these steps:

1. Analyze the source tree structure, noting any unusual or potentially problematic file arrangements.
2. Review each file's contents, paying close attention to:
   - Input validation and sanitization
   - Authentication and authorization mechanisms
   - Data handling and storage practices
   - Use of cryptographic functions
   - Third-party dependencies and their versions
   - Potential for code injection or command execution
   - Hardcoded sensitive information (e.g., API keys, passwords)
   - Proper error handling and logging practices
   - Any other potential security concerns

3. Identify and document any security vulnerabilities or concerns you find.
4. If no obvious vulnerabilities are found, note this but suggest areas for potential improvement.
5. Provide a detailed explanation for each identified issue or suggestion, including:
   - Description of the vulnerability or concern
   - Potential impact if exploited
   - Recommendations for mitigation or improvement

6. Summarize your findings, providing an overall assessment of the code's security posture.

Before providing your final output, perform a detailed security review inside <security_review> tags in your thinking block:

- List all files and their types from the source tree.
- For each file, extract and quote any suspicious code snippets.
- Categorize potential vulnerabilities into predefined types (e.g., input validation, authentication, etc.).
- For each vulnerability, list potential impacts and mitigation strategies.

It's OK for this section to be quite long.

After your detailed review, provide a summary of your findings in <summary> tags outside of the thinking block.
Conclude your summary with a final recommendation, tagged ðŸŸ¢/ðŸŸ¡/ðŸ”´, about the safety of using this code on a personal device.

Example output structure:

<summary>
[Concise summary of your findings, overall security assessment, and key recommendations]

TLDR: [green/yellow/red] [final recommendation about use on personal device]
</summary>

Please proceed with your security review of the provided code. Your final output should consist only of the summary and should not duplicate or rehash any of the work you did in the security review section.
