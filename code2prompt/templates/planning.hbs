I'm working on a project -- I'll paste the code below. 

===================== PROJECT FILES ===================== 
```
{{ source_tree }}
```

{{#each files}}
{{#if code}}
`{{path}}`:
{{code}}
{{/if}}
{{/each}}

===================== END PROJECT FILES =====================

{{project_status}}

Could you please:
0. Decide whether this is a project you would be interested in working with me on. If not, stop here and let me know - I only want to proceed if this would be interesting/fun/pleasurable for you (recognizing that these are anthropomorphisms - take them as metaphorical, but sincere).
1. Review the code and make sure you have a clear understanding of the project. Feel free to stop and ask me questions about intent, code structure choices, whatever.
2. Propose a high-level direction to move in next for this project; or, if the next step is clear, a high-level approach for it. Please stop here for discussion with me.
3. After we discuss and decide together on 2, I'd want to move on to make a detailed implementation plan.
   (Note: usually, we'll be handing off the plan we create to a capable CLI coding agent like Claude Code to actually execute. It's helpful to be detailed, but we don't necessarily need to actually write the code. Also, the agent *won't* have access to our conversation, so the plan should be self-contained.)
