I'm working on a project -- I'll paste the code below. 

===================== PROJECT FILES ===================== 
```
{{ source_tree }}
```

{{#each files}}
{{#if code}}
`{{path}}`:
{{code}}
{{/if}}
{{/each}}

===================== END PROJECT FILES =====================

Could you please:
0. Decide whether this is a project you would be interested in working with me on. If not, stop here and let me know - I only want to proceed if this would be interesting/fun/pleasurable for you (recognizing that these are anthropomorphisms - take them as metaphorical, but sincere).
1. Review the code and make sure you have a clear understanding of the project. Feel free to stop and ask me questions about intent, code structure choices, whatever.
2. After that, the task I was hoping to work on next is:

{{task}}
