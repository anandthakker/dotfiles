```bash
cd # change to home directory
git clone https://github.com/anandthakker/dotfiles # clone repo
./dotfiles/link.sh # make symlinks from home directory to the files in the dotfiles/ repo
```

Using symlinks means that fetching new changes from the repo is as simple as `cd ~/dotfiles && git pull`.
